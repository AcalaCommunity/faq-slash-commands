# Acala Crowdloan FAQ

## check-contribution
### How do I check my crowdloan contribution?
Go to https://acala.network/acala/join-acala/bonus to check your contribution and track your rewards.


## sell-lcdot
### What happens if I sell my lcDOT?
Contributors that made a Liquid Crowdloan Contribution must hold lcDOT at the end of the parachain lease in order to redeem their lcDOT for DOT. If these contributors no longer hold lcDOT, they wonâ€™t be able to redeem for DOT. However, selling lcDOT has no impact on ACA rewards. 


## price-lcdot
### What will be the price of lcDOT?
The price of lcDOT will be determined by the free market. Acala does not control the price of lcDOT. We also have a policy of not discussing price in this server. You can discuss price in community-run, Acala+ server https://discord.gg/HCpBgJc7. 


## price-talk
### Server rules about price talk
We do not discuss price in this server. You can discuss price in community-run, Acala+ server https://discord.gg/HCpBgJc7.


## wen-tokens
### When will I receive my ACA tokens?
We know that the community is eager to receive their tokens. The distribution of tokens is one of the launch phases in our rollout. The Acala network is expected to launch on December 17th and tokens from Build Acala and the crowdloan will be distributed after transfers are enabled.


## claim-tokens
### Do I need to claim my tokens?
Only users that contributed to the crowdloan directly through the Polkadot.js.org WEBSITE need to go through the claims process. The reason they need to do this is because they have not yet agreed to the Terms and Conditions of the crowdloan. We'll soon be publishing instructions on how users that need to go through claims can do this.


## where-tokens
### Where will I receive my tokens?
Crowdloan contributors will receive their tokens in the account they used to make their crowdloan contribution. There is no need to set up a new account or wallet. Build Acala participants will receive their tokens in the DOT account they listed in their profile on the Build Acala event platform.


## reap-rewards
### Will I still receive my tokens if my account fell below the existential deposit?
Yes. This will not impact your ability to receive rewards.


## build-vesting
### What is the vesting schedule?
Participants in the April Build Acala event have no vesting on their ACA tokens. Participants in the August/September Build Acala event have a 3 month vest on their ACA tokens.


## crowdloan-vesting
### What is the vesting schedule?
20% of your ACA crowdloan rewards will be delivered to you as liquid and transferrable. The remaining 80% will vest/unlock linearly (every block) over the 96 week parachain lease.
