# Acala Crowdloan FAQ

## get-referral
### How do I get a referral code?
There are two ways to get a referral code. Users on the waitlist can complete the first two Acala Quests to receive their referral code via email. Users not on the waitlist can receive a referral code after they make their crowdloan contribution.


## change-referral
### How do I change the DOT address linked to my referral code?
Users on the waitlist are the only users that can change the DOT address linked to their referral code.
To change the DOT address, redo Quests 1 and 2 using your waitlist email address and the new DOT address you'd like to use for your referral link. Your new referral link will be emailed to you.

## 10-bonus
### How do I get my 10% referral bonus?
To get your 10% ACA bonus, enter YOUR referral code to self-refer when you make YOUR crowdloan contribution. You'll receive a 5% ACA bonus as the referrer and 5% ACA bonus as referee for a total of 10% bonus on YOUR DOT contribution. Share YOUR referral code with others and receive a 5% bonus in ACA on THEIR DOT contributions.


## 5-bonus
### How do I get my 5% referral bonus?
Enter SOMEONE ELSE'S referral code when you make YOUR crowdloan contribution to receive a 5% bonus in ACA on YOUR DOT contribution. After you make YOUR crowdloan contribution, Acala will give you YOUR OWN referral code that you can share with others to receive 5% bonus in ACA on THEIR DOT contributions.


## 2-karura
### How do I get my 2% Karura Crowdloan bonus?
If you contributed to the Karura Crowdloan, you must make your Acala Crowdloan contribution with the same account that you used to make your Karura contribution. If you do this, you will receive a 2% bonus in ACA on YOUR DOT contribution.

## how-lcdot
### How does Liquid Crowdloan Contribution work? 
Select the Liquid Crowdloan option when making your contribution on the Acala website or Polkawallet. After the Acala network launches, you will receive your ACA rewards plus lcDOT. lcDOT will be issued on a 1:1 basis against your DOT contribution and can be redeemed for DOT on a 1:1 basis at Acala's parachain lease expiration. lcDOT allows you to access the liquidity in your crowdloan contribution because lcDOT can be used in Acala’s DeFi primitives (e.g., trade, transfer, collateralize). It's important to note that the Liquid Crowdloan option is not completely trustless. It requires you to contribute your DOT to the Liquid Crowdoan Vault managed by the Acala Foundation. This vault will be managed by the Acala Foundation until ownership of the vault is transferred to the Acala parachain. If you are looking for a way to trustlessly contribute, make a Direct Polkadot Contribution.


## risks-lcdot
### What are the risks of the Liquid Crowdloan Contribution method?
Contributors using this method need to trust the Acala Foundation to manage the Liquid Crowdloan Vault until Vault ownership is transferred to the Acala parachain. We do not foresee any technical risk with this approach.


## what-lcdot
### What is lcDOT?
Liquid Crowdloan DOT (lcDOT) represents the underlying DOT liquidity of an Acala Crowdloan DOT contribution. When a participant contributes DOT via the Liquid Crowdloan option, they will receive lcDOT, a liquid (unlocked) token available for use on Acala’s DeFi hub in addition to ACA rewards. lcDOT can be used to swap, collateralize for a self-serviced loan in aUSD stablecoin, and more. lcDOT is redeemable for DOT on a 1:1 basis at the end of Acala’s parachain lease.


## sell-lcdot
### What happens if I sell my lcDOT?
Contributors that made a Liquid Crowdloan Contribution must hold lcDOT at the end of the parachain lease in order to redeem their lcDOT for DOT. If these contributors no longer hold lcDOT, they won’t be able to redeem for DOT. However, selling lcDOT has no impact on ACA rewards. 


## price-lcdot
### What will be the price of lcDOT?
The price of lcDOT will be determined by the free market. Acala does not control the price of lcDOT. We also have a policy of not discussing price in this server. You can discuss price in community-run, Acala+ server https://discord.gg/HCpBgJc7. 


## price-talk
We do not discuss price in this server. You can discuss price in community-run, Acala+ server https://discord.gg/HCpBgJc7.


## number-aca
### How many ACA will I receive for each DOT contributed?
The ACA to DOT ratio will be announced at a later time. 170,000,000 ACA tokens (17% of the fixed supply) will be distributed to crowdloan contributors.


## wen-aca
### When will I receive my ACA tokens?
You will receive your ACA after Acala wins a parachain slot, launches the network (expected to be December 15, 2021), and enables token transfers.


## vesting
### What is the vesting schedule?
20% of your ACA rewards will be delivered to you as liquid and transferrable. The remaining 80% will vest/unlock linearly (every block) over the 96 week parachain lease.
